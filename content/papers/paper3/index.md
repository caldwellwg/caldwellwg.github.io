##### Abstract

We present arguments to support the existence of weight spaces for supersymmetric field theories and identify the calculations of information about supermultiplets to define such spaces via the concept of ‚Äúholoraumy.‚Äù For the first time, this is extended to the complex linear superfield by a calculation of the commutator of supercovariant derivatives on all of its component fields.
